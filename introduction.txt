Hey! My name is Joynn, I'm a Sophomore majoring in Data Science at BU! In my free time I like reading, swimming, and city walking. My favorite class so far has been this class because I actually get to do hands-on practices that are beneficial for my career and core classes. A fun fact about me is that I have a twin atNortheastern University. Believe it or not!
